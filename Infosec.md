# Cybersecurity Basics

## Cyber Kill Chain
[This is based on the Lockheed-Martin White Paper](https://www.lockheedmartin.com/content/dam/lockheed/data/corporate/documents/LM-White-Paper-Intel-Driven-Defense.pdf)
- Reconnaisance
- Weaponization
- Delivery
- Exploitation
- Installation
- Command & Control (C2)
- Actions on Objectives

## Phases of Attack
Depending on who you ask, there can be anywhere from 5-7 phases (usually). They are usually in some form of the following:
- Reconnaisance
- Scanning
- Gaining Access
- Maintaining Access
- Covering Tracks / Reporting
Here are a few links that describe variations of this cycle:

## Stages of Incident Response
- Preparation
- Identification (Detection & Analysis)
- Containment
- Eradication
- Recovery
- Lessons Learned (Post-Incident Activity)

## OWASP Top 10
It's difficult to analyze and respond to something you don't understand, so a good start is the OWASP Top 10:
